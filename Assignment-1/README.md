# Assignment 1

  My favorite website of the options given was the Experiments with Google/WebGL site (https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL) because 
of how interactive shaders were mostly interactive. For example, there was a car demo where I could move the car with WASD and control the 
camera (https://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_cars.html). And a bunch of other shaders I looked at could be manipulated with scroll wheel.
The Shadertoys site was cool in its own right because you can see the code for each shader and it has statistics on how well the shader is running,
but I prefered the interactivity of the Experiments with Google site.
